# apple-container-sandbox

Ad-hoc Linux sandboxes on [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container).
Each sandbox is a persistent home dir, container, and zellij session keyed by a
single `<name>`, all sharing one image built from `image/Dockerfile`.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/brhelwig/apple-container-sandbox.git ~/.sandbox
~/.sandbox/install.sh   # creates ~/Sandboxes, prints the PATH line to add
```

`gum` is required for the menu (`brew install gum`).

## Usage

```sh
sandbox              # menu: launch a sandbox, or create/rename/delete
sandbox myproject    # launch "myproject" (offers to create it if new)
sandbox --help
```

Homes live at `~/Sandboxes/<name>` and are mounted as the container's entire
home, so auth, config, and shell history persist across image rebuilds and stay
separate between sandboxes. The container mounts **only** the home dir — drop
files into `~/Sandboxes/<name>` in Finder.

## Packages

Edit `packages.toml` (apt / brew taps / formulae / casks / post_install). The
image rebuilds automatically when `packages.toml` or `image/` changes.

## Security scope

This is a **convenience sandbox, not a security boundary.** Know what it does
and does not protect:

- **No network controls.** The container has unrestricted network access — it
  reaches the internet and your LAN like any host process. Nothing here
  firewalls, proxies, or limits egress.
- **Secrets are written to the filesystem in plaintext — not a keychain.** A
  sandbox's home is a bind mount at `~/Sandboxes/<name>` on your host. Anything
  written there (`gh`, `gcloud`, `aws` credentials, SSH keys, tokens, shell
  history) is stored as plain files on your host disk. Linux has no
  macOS-Keychain equivalent in play, so nothing lands in an OS secret store —
  at-rest protection is only whatever your host provides (disk encryption, file
  permissions, backups).
- **Isolation is VM/process-level only.** Each sandbox runs in its own Apple
  Container (a lightweight Linux VM), separating sandboxes from each other and
  from macOS — but a sandbox still runs your code with full network and your
  mounted home. It is not a jail for untrusted code.

**Bottom line: a sandbox is only as secure as the host it runs on.** Don't put
secrets in a sandbox you wouldn't put on the host, and don't run untrusted code
expecting containment.

## Tests

```sh
bash test/run.sh
```
